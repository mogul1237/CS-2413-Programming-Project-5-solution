Objectives
1. [50 Points] Create all the methods and fields to implement the parent array implementation of the binary tree data structure. You are required to demonstrate the working of the following methods for each of the methods by invoking them from a main program. a. empty constructor b. non-empty constructor (sets the initial size of the arrays) c. destructor d. copy constructor e. overloaded equal to operator f. ostream operator â€“ pre order traversal g. size method h. height method i. getLeft method j. getRight method k. preorder traversal method l. inorder traversal method m. postorder traversal method 2. [20 Points] Read the redirected input and create all the data structures. 3. [20 Points] Demonstrate the working of all the methods. 4. [10 Points] Document your project thoroughly as the examples in the textbook. This includes but not limited to header comments for all classes/methods, explanatory comments for each section of code, meaningful variable and method names, and consistent indentation.
Project Description
Consider a binary tree with N nodes where each the nodes are given unique numbers in the range 0..N-1. Such a binary tree can be stored in in an array P of size N, wherein P[k] will indicate the parent of node numbered k in the binary tree. See the binary tree and the corresponding parent array below.

Parent Array P
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 3 6 5 2 3 -1 5 6 7 8
Since 5 does not have a parent with placed a -1.
To recognize if a node is left (0) or right child (1) we have,
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 1 -1 1 1 0 1
Examples: Node 0 is a left child of node 3 hence a 0. Node 6 is a right child of node 5 hence a 1.
The input to your project will be as follows: The first line of input will be number of nodes in the binary tree. If a node does not have a left or right child we will place a -1 otherwise, we will put the number of the left or right child. For the above tree, the input is given below.
10 5 2 6 2 3 -1 3 0 4 6 1 7 1 -1 -1 0 -1 -1 8 -1 9 9 -1 -1 4 -1 -1 7 8 -1
Class Structures
You are required to implement the following class structure along with the implementation of the methods associated with each of them.
